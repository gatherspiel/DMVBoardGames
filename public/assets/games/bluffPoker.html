    <h1>Bluff Poker(Creator unknown). Rules updated by Bharat Ponnaluri</h1>
    <h2>Overview of game:</h2>
    <p>Bluff poker is a combination of bluff and poker where players will bet on increasingly strong hands. Every time
    a player is caught bluffing or incorrectly says that someone is bluffing, they get a point. A player is eliminated
      from the game when they have too many points.</p>

    <h2>Setting up the game for the first round</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Agree on the maximum number of points a player can have before they are eliminated.</li>
      <li>Shuffle a standard 52 card deck and deal 1 card to each player.</li>
      <li>Pick a random start player.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Playing a round:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The start player picks a poker hand, and names one card in that hand which has the highest value. If a
          player is claiming a flush is present, they must also name the suit of the highest value card. When naming a hand,
         a player is claiming that the hand can be made from the cards in everyone's hand.</li>
        <li>Play continues clockwise. Players can either name a higher value hand or call bluff on the previous claim.</li>
        <li>If a player calls a bluff, then everyone reveals their hand. If the claimed hand can be made from the
        revealed cards, then the player who called the bluff gets a point. If not, then the player who made the incorrect
        claim gets two points, and the player who called the bluff loses a point.</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>What to do after a round:</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>If a player has more points than the maximum, they are eliminated from the game. If only one player remains,
          they win.</li>
        <li>Shuffle all 52 cards, Deal one card to each player for each point they have. If a player has 0 points or
        negative points, they do not get any cards.</li>
        <li>Set the start player to the one who most recently got a point.</li>
      </ul>

    and their rankings.

    <h2>Advice for playing:</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>Consider the number of cards people have when claiming a hand. For example, on the first round of a 4
      player game, everyone will only have 1 card, which makes it impossible for a straight to be present.</li>
      <li>Estimate the probabilities of certain hands being present. On the first round of a 5 player game,
      the chances of a pair being present is approximately 50%. The odds of correctly picking a number of the
      card in the pair is lower. </li>
      <li>Later in the game, the probability of higher value hands increases significantly. As a result, opening with
       a higher value claim such as "Flush, high card ace of spades." becomes a good idea.</li>
      </ul>
