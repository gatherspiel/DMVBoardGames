                Evaluating and implementing technologies for the website. Right
                now, the frontend site is built with Vite, vanilla JavaScript,
                and vanilla CSS. However, there are other options for the
                frontend that might be better.

            </ul>
            <li>
              Backend and infrastructure. The website will use a shared open
              source backend and shared infrastructure This backend will also be
              used to support other websites for creating and hosting in person
              events
