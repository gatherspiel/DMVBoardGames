            <p>Growing up, I was a fan of classic board games, especially Chess, Monopoly, and Risk. In college, I was
            actively looking for places to play board games. Eventually, I learned Catan, and then found

            <a href="https://uiucsocialgamingclub.wordpress.com/games/">groups.<a> Since then, I have made
            playing board games a regular part of my schedule, and I started
            <a href="https://www.meetup.com/beerbogglers/events/311843501/?eventOrigin=group_upcoming_events">host events</a>. I have played over
            900 different board games with a variety of mechanics. Here are some of my favorites.</p>

            I initially decided to start programming because I wanted to make games. Over the years, I've created
            a variety of games as personal projects including an attempt to create a
              <a href="https://github.com/UnknownOrange/Clash-Of-Empires-App/tree/master">real time version of Risk.</a>.
            Shortly after graduating college, I stepped away from making games and started working full time as a
            software engineer in a variety of different industries. In additional to programming focused roles,
             I also spent time working as a team facilitator, which was called a scrum master.

            I've also designed board games for fun and playested them at various events  <a href="https://www.bponnaluri.com/board-games/">Here</a> are some
            of the designs I worked on.
