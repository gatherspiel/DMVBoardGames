      <p>Growing up, I enjoyed classic board games, especially Chess, Monopoly, and Risk. In college, I
        learned Catan, and then joined
      <a href="https://www.illinimetagamers.net/programs/game-night">gaming </a>
      <a href="https://uiucsocialgamingclub.wordpress.com/games/">groups.<a> Since then, I have made
      playing board games a regular part of my schedule, and I started
      <a href="https://www.meetup.com/beerbogglers/events/311843501/?eventOrigin=group_upcoming_events">hosting events</a>. I have played over
      900 different board games with a variety of mechanics. Here are some of my favorites.</p>

        I initially decided to start programming because I wanted to make games. Over the years, I've created
        a variety of games as personal projects including an attempt to create a
          <a href="https://github.com/UnknownOrange/Clash-Of-Empires-App/tree/master">real time version of Risk</a>.
        Shortly after graduating college, I stepped away from making games and started working full time as a
        software engineer in a variety of different industries. In additional to programming focused roles,
         I also spent time working as a team facilitator, which was called a scrum master.

        I've also designed board games for fun and playested them at various events  <a href="https://www.bponnaluri.com/board-games/">Here</a> are some
        of the designs I worked on.
