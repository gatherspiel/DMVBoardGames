        <h3>This page contains some thoughts on manual testing and why I think it is important when automated testing
        is another option</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Manual testing is straightforward, as a tester just needs to access the site like a regular user. When there
          is an issue, the tester gets immediate feedback in the form of something not working and can look at the browser
          console fo more information. For example, in the screenshot below, an event search was attempted and search results
          did not show up on the screen, which indicated that there was a bug. From looking at the browser console, there
          is an error message indicating an error with parsing the max distance parameter.</li>

          <li>When an error occurs, it is clear that the error is from something related to the website and not an issue with
          the test. For example, in the screenshot below, event searching failed because of an issue connecting to the server.
          At the time, the backend was not running in the test environment.</li>

          <li>Manual tests encourge testing to be done in a manner similar to how users will use the site. As a result,
            testers will notice usability issues in addition to bugs.</li>
          </li>
