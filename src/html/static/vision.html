      <b>
      The goal of dmvboardgames.com is to promote human connection through board games as a way of
      increasing interest in public spaces. To promote this goal, these guidelines wil be followed for any changes.
      </b>
    </p>

    <h2>Support for in person interaction</h2>

    <p>All content added will support the goal of encouraging people to interact in person. For example,
      a feature that makes it easier for people to find in person events would be a good fit for the website.
      Changes to improve usability or readability of the website also support this goal.

      Forums, comments, or any other form of online messaging will not be supported by dmvboardgames.com. People should
      be encouraged to meet and exchange contact information in person before communicating online.
    </p>

    <h2>All content is human generated</h2>

    <p>Dmvboardgames.com will be developed and maintained by humans without the use of automated tools such as
      bots or generative AI. Users will also not be allowed to use automated tools to interact with the website.</p>


    <h2>No personalized recommendations</h2>

    <p>Dmvboardgames.com will not provide personalized recommendations. Users are encouraged to get recommendations
      through connecting with others in person at events.  When users see events or other content,
      it should be because they made a decision to view that content.
    </p>

    <h2>Non Commercial</h2>

    <p>Dmvboardgames.com will not be a profit making entity. Monetization will be minimized and only be used for the goal
      of supporting expenses associated with the platform.
    </p>

    <h2>Decentralization</h2>

    <p>
      Information about events and groups will be accessible using a free public API. Users can then use
      that information on their own websites.

      All code used on dmvboardgames.com will also be open source and able to be used by people looking to self
      host their own event websites.
