  <h1>Crystal City Landing</h1>
  <p>
    For more than 10 years, The Landing in Crystal City was a cornerstone of the DMV
    board game community.

    This page shows what made the Landing a great public space, and issues that lead to the Landing no longer being
    viable as a place to host events. Difficultly in finding public space for board game events is an ongoing challenge, and we should be encouraging
    the creation of more accessible public spaces.

  <h2>My experience with the Landing</h2>
  <p>
    In 2002, I walked through the underground mall at Crystal City and ended up eating lunch at the food court that
    later become The Landing.  While I was interested in the idea of an underground mall, I felt like the mall
    was somewhat old and unappealing.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    I didnâ€™t end up going back for a long time until around 2014 when I ate at a nearby restaurant. I noticed the food court was renovated into a
    place called The Landing with many tables and chairs.  While I was looking to play more board
    games, I did not initially view The Landing as a place to play them.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    Shortly afterwards, I started going to Thursday game nights at a board game store called Labyrinth Games & Puzzles. At one of the
    events, I played Kingdom Builder with someone who mentioned there was a board game event at the Landing every Friday. The
    next day, I went to the Landing and played Castles of Burgundy. I had a good time with the people I met and I started
    going there every Friday.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    The group was significantly larger than I expected and there were a variety of games being played. Regulars were
    very welcoming to people who were new, and I was happy that I could show up late and still join a game. Around 50 or more
    people would typically show up each Friday. The Landing as located was at a centrally located place with free parking,
    an indoor connection to the Crystal City Metro station, and a variety of food options. There was a large seating
    area that could fit around 100 people that  was not very crowded, and we were able to stay there past midnight.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2>Experiencing the decline of the Landing</h2>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, the Landing as a public space started to decline as restaurants nearby closed, including fast food places where people
    could buy dinner or a snack. Also, tables and shares slowly started to be removed. One major step in this decline
    was in 2018 when an area near the Landing with some seating closed off. This area was sometimes used during Friday
    events when space at the Landing was limited.

    In addition to a decline in food options, tables and chairs started to get removed. In 2021 I ended up becoming a host for the
    Friday game night, and ran into challenges with the ongoing decline.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>
    Also, the decline in availability of public spaces across the DC area caused challenges. The Landing became
    increasingly crowded on Friday evenings due to a lack of alternative options. While the Landing became more crowded,
    more and chairs started to be removed, which made it harder to host events there.

    Although there were still were bars and restaurants nearby, expensive food prices, limited opening hours, or limited table space
    were issues. On the other hand the Landing was open past midnight, and people didn't need to spend money on expensive
    food.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>In the spring of 2024, it was announced that the remaining stores and restaurants in the Crystal City Underground
  would close. I tried contacting the landlord for more information, and work with them to find an alternative space.
  They did not respond to me. On August 30th, 2024, I found out that all the tables and chairs were removed from
  The Landing shortly before I was going to host a board game event there.

  <h2>History </h2>

  <h3>Initial history of Crystal City Underground</h3>
  <p>
    Crystal City became a major jobs center which included a large number of government contractors and the USPTO. A
    mall was opened in 1976 which would become known as the Crystal City Underground. It included a food court, supermarket,
    various bars and restaurants, and retail.
  </p>
  <h3>Crystal City after loss of office jobs.</h3>

  <p> Due to BRAC and the USPTO moving, Crystal City lost many office works</p>
  <h3>Decline of the Underground, loss of viability of the Landing, and losing the tables and chairs.</h3>
